### <p align = "center"> uSAIL is a complete Smart Appraisal solution, created for smart employers to automatically determine the appraisal rate for an employee - based on the user data collected from their official devices, using multiple Key Performance Indices (KPIs) as parameters</p>

## INSPIRATION ⭐

It's a known fact that corporate laptops are under full surveillance of the companies. The company can access almost all data on that device like browser history, installed software and programs, screen uptime, sleep cycles of the device, and many more. Therefore, these data can be very useful in creating a brief scorecard of an employee monitoring his overall performance all around the year. There’s a need to create a model to determine the scores based on data acquired from an employee's device so that the company can award appraisals based on these scores.

With the Work-From-Home system slowly getting adopted in the corporate culture, employers feel the need to keep a check on their employees’ overall productivity and reward them for their integrity on the basis of how wisely they are using their official devices during work hours. This also leaves space for an employee to gain a special appraisal based on their own performance.

## OUR SOLUTION 📌

With the vision of creating a solution that provides a mutual benefit for both the employers and employees, we present to **uSAIL - A Smart Appraisal Index Logs** system, that intakes the different data logged from the employee’s office device’s usage patterns, and maps them into multiple Key Performance Indices (KPIs). We call the scale, **Employee Integrity Index.**

The pre-estimated thresholds of the KPI Metrics determine the Appraisal amount automatically for a particular employee based on the parameters as defined by the employers. Employees can check their KPI Scorecard and Appraisal value by logging into the platform with a unique key generated by the system. The employers have access and can manage the Admin’s dashboard where they can compare KPI data for multiple users as well as check complete details for a particular employee.

> **Primary Assumptions:**
>
> - The company tracks the following data from the employee’s device: Browser History, Email History, Data inflow/outflows, 3rd Party Application Usage, Workspace uptime, Activity on Slack/MS Teams/Jira other office management software.
> - The data tracked from their devices is available in exportable and importable format for the solution determine the metrics and sort them into multiple Key Performance Indices (KPIs).
